## Introduction

Provisioning clinical data for research frequently necessitates removing or masking identifying information, including personally identifiable information (PII), especially when providing safe harbor and limited data. Compared to electronic health record data coded with other terminologies, some Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)-coded data may be associated with identifying information. Using a two-step procedure consisting of a keyword search of Long Common Names and filtering on selected Property values followed by expert physician review, we found 1,309 LOINC terms potentially associated with identifying information of patients, healthcare providers, and healthcare facilities. This list of codes is publicly available and will be a valuable resource for enhancing deidentification workflows to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

## Table

The table containing the list of codes has seven columns: LOINC_NUM, LONG_COMMON_NAME, PROPERTY, CLASSTYPE, CLASS, Keyword, and Category. The first five refer to attributes in the LOINC database, and the authors developed the last two.
